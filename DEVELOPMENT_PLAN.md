# Smart Tree Development Plan

## Current Project Status

Smart Tree is a modern directory tree viewer that intelligently displays file hierarchies with an emphasis on readability. Unlike traditional `tree` commands that output everything (often producing thousands of lines), Smart Tree makes smart decisions about what to show and what to fold.

### Implemented Features

- **Core Scanning Engine**: Traverses directories and collects metadata
- **Intelligent Folding**: Automatically folds known system directories (.git, node_modules)
- **Line Budget Management**: Respects terminal limitations while preserving context
- **Head/Tail Display Pattern**: Shows both beginning and end of large listings
- **Sorting Options**: By name, size, modified time, creation time
- **GitIgnore Integration**: Basic folding based on gitignore patterns
- **Metadata Display**: File sizes, modification times, directory statistics
- **CLI Interface**: Configurable options via command line arguments

### Known Issues

- Tests have duplicated code in `display/tests.rs` that prevents compilation
- Gitignore pattern matching is overly simplified
- Performance concerns for large directory structures
- Full directory tree kept in memory (could be problematic for large trees)
- Limited terminal width consideration

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Code Cleanup and Bug Fixes (Immediate Priority) ✅

1. **Fix Test Suite Errors** ✅
   - Remove duplicated test_utils module and ExpectedContent struct
   - Fix duplicated test functions
   - Ensure tests pass with `cargo test`

2. **Fix Code Quality Issues** ✅
   - Address all compiler warnings
   - Apply consistent formatting with `cargo fmt`
   - Run clippy and fix linting issues

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Review use of unwrap/expect and replace with proper error handling
   - Improve error messages and recovery

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Enhancement (Short Term)

1. **Improve GitIgnore Integration** ✅
   - Implement proper gitignore pattern matching
   - Support standard gitignore syntax with globs

2. **Memory Optimization** ✅
   - Implement streaming/lazy loading approach for large directories
   - Reduce memory usage for very large directory structures

3. **Performance Improvements**
   - Optimize directory traversal for large directory structures
   - Implement metadata caching for frequently accessed directories
   - Consider parallel scanning for improved performance

### Phase 3: UI and UX Enhancements (Medium Term)

1. **Terminal Integration**
   - Add terminal width consideration for improved display
   - Implement color support for different file types and metadata
   - Add interactive navigation features

2. **Advanced Display Options**
   - Implement customizable display templates
   - Add file type recognition and specialized displays
   - Support different view modes (compact, detailed)

3. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Implement icons for file types (when terminal supports it)
   - Add progress indicators for scanning large directories
   - Improve the visual hierarchy indicators
   
4. **Usability Improvements**
   - Implement shorter command-line aliases (e.g., -n for --max-lines)
   - Evaluate program name and consider alternatives (e.g., "st" for Smart Tree)
   - Improve help messages with clearer examples and option descriptions
   - Add bash/zsh completions for improved user experience

### Phase 4: Distribution and Integration (Medium Term)

1. **Package and Distribution**
   - Create installation script (install.sh) for simple cross-platform installation
   - Package for Homebrew (brew) installation on macOS
   - Implement continuous integration/deployment pipeline
   - Set up automated GitHub releases with versioned branches (e.g., 'v0.2.0')

2. **Integration Features**
   - VCS integration (show modified files since last commit)
   - Build system integration for project-specific views
   - Configuration file support for project defaults
   - Add support for config file in multiple formats (.json, .toml)

### Phase 5: Feature Expansion (Long Term)

1. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Implement complex file filtering based on patterns
   - Add time-based filtering (recently modified, older than X)
   - Support regex-based content filtering

2. **Export Capabilities**
   - JSON/XML export of directory structure
   - HTML visualization export
   - Integration with other tools via standardized output formats

3. **Advanced Integration**
   - Add plugin system for custom extensions
   - Implement extensions for popular development tools
   - Add language-specific statistics gathering

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Focus on backwards compatibility for existing command-line options
- Prioritize performance and memory efficiency throughout implementation
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Documentation Plan

1. Complete missing README.md sections
   - Key Features section
   - Complete Design Philosophy section
   - Development setup instructions

2. Create developer documentation
   - Architecture overview with diagrams
   - Key algorithms explanation
   - Performance considerations

3. Build comprehensive usage documentation
   - Command-line option reference
   - Advanced usage examples
   - Integration with other tools
