# Smart Tree Development Plan

## Current Project Status

Smart Tree is a modern directory tree viewer that intelligently displays file hierarchies with an emphasis on readability. Unlike traditional `tree` commands that output everything (often producing thousands of lines), Smart Tree makes smart decisions about what to show and what to fold.

### Implemented Features

- **Core Scanning Engine**: Traverses directories and collects metadata
- **Intelligent Folding**: Automatically folds known system directories (.git, node_modules)
- **Line Budget Management**: Respects terminal limitations while preserving context
- **Head/Tail Display Pattern**: Shows both beginning and end of large listings
- **Sorting Options**: By name, size, modified time, creation time
- **GitIgnore Integration**: Basic folding based on gitignore patterns
- **Metadata Display**: File sizes, modification times, directory statistics
- **CLI Interface**: Configurable options via command line arguments
- **Color and Emoji Support**: Rich visual enhancements for improved readability

### Known Issues

- âœ… ~~Gitignore pattern matching could be further improved~~
- âœ… ~~Performance concerns for large directory structures~~
- âœ… ~~Full directory tree kept in memory (could be problematic for large trees)~~
- âœ… ~~Limited terminal width consideration~~
- âœ… ~~T-shape vs L-shape connectors display incorrectly for the last items~~
- âœ… ~~Program collapses lines where only 1 item is hidden (inefficient)~~
- Contents of .git (and other system directories) cannot be viewed even when explicitly requested
- Does not properly respect nested .gitignore files in subdirectories
- No option to explicitly show system directories that are normally hidden

## Development Roadmap

### Critical Fixes (Immediate Priority)

1. **Fix System Directory Exclusion Logic**
   - Add a flag to explicitly show contents of system directories
   - Modify `display/state.rs` to respect this flag when rendering directories

2. **Improve .gitignore Detection and Handling**
   - Implement recursive .gitignore detection to respect nested .gitignore files
   - Load and apply .gitignore rules at each directory level

     - âœ… Add detailed metadata display option
     - âœ… Add size-based color gradients
     - âœ… Add date-based color gradients

3. **Visual Enhancements**
   - âœ… Implement icons for file types (emoji support)
   - Add progress indicators for scanning large directories
   - âœ… Improve the visual hierarchy indicators
   
4. **Usability Improvements**
   - Implement shorter command-line aliases (e.g., -n for --max-lines)
   - Evaluate program name and consider alternatives (e.g., "st" for Smart Tree)
   - Improve help messages with clearer examples and option descriptions
   - Add bash/zsh completions for improved user experience

### Phase 4: Distribution and Integration (Medium Term)

1. **Package and Distribution**

## Implementation Details for Upcoming Work

### Gitignore and System Directory Handling Design

1. **Recursive GitIgnore Detection**
   ```
   App
   â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore (ignores *.log)
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore (ignores *.tmp)
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore (ignores *.bak)
   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
   â””â”€â”€ ...
   ```

   - Each directory's .gitignore rules should apply to itself and all subdirectories
   - Later .gitignore files take precedence over earlier ones
   - Parent rules can be negated by child rules (using ! prefix)

2. **Scanner Implementation**
   ```rust
   pub struct GitIgnoreContext {
       patterns: Vec<GitIgnore>,
   }

   impl GitIgnoreContext {
       // Load initial .gitignore from root
       pub fn new(root: &Path) -> Self { ... }

       // Check if path matches any pattern in any loaded .gitignore
       pub fn is_ignored(&self, path: &Path) -> bool { ... }

       // Process a directory, loading any .gitignore found there
       pub fn process_directory(&mut self, dir_path: &Path) { ... }
   }
   ```

3. **System Directory Handling**
   - Add new CLI option: `--show-system-dirs` to show system directories
   - Modify scanner to mark system dirs but traverse them if explicitly requested
   - Update display logic to respect this setting

## Test Strategy

1. **Unit Tests for GitIgnore Context**
   - Test recursive .gitignore file loading
   - Test pattern application from multiple .gitignore files
   - Test precedence rules between parent and child patterns

2. **Integration Tests with Nested Repositories**
   - Set up test directories with nested git repositories
   - Verify correct traversal behavior with and without explicit inclusion
   - Test with `--show-system-dirs` flag

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Create a test suite that verifies real-world nested repository scenarios
   - Test performance with large repositories containing multiple .gitignore files

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Focus on backwards compatibility for existing command-line options
- Prioritize performance and memory efficiency throughout implementation
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
